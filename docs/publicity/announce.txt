This release is part of the "development" release series, but these development
releases are suitable for production use: the only difference between them and
"stable" releases is that neither ABI nor API stability is guaranteed in 3.3.x.
However we strive to minimize API-incompatible changes even so and, in spite of
a huge number of changes since the last stable version, this release remains
almost fully API-compatible with wxWidgets 3.2 and updating the existing
applications to use it should be straightforward. However please make sure to
read the "INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES" section in the change log to be aware of the
breaking changes in it.


We hope that you will enjoy using the new release!

Vadim Zeitlin, on behalf of wxWidgets development team.
